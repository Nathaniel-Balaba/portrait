        There are times when I'm lying in my bed
        How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
        And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
        Almost rubbed-down, swelling
        As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
        Heaven knows how embittered I am
        'Cause this angel has flown away from me
        Leaving me with drunken misery
        I should have clipped her wings
        And made her mine for all eternity
        Now, this angel has flown away from me
        Thought I had the strength to set her free
        Did what I did because I love her so
        Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
        I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
        Being up all night in this elbow room
        That puts me in a trance
        Where hopes and dreams come true
        Now, my lips are burning
        And my eyes are hurting
        From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
        Just to pass my time, oh
        Heaven knows how embittered I am
        'Cause this angel has flown away from me
        Leaving me with drunken misery
        I should have clipped her wings
        And made her mine for all eternity
        Now, this angel has flown away from me
        Thought I had the strength to set her free
        Did what I did because I love her so
        Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
